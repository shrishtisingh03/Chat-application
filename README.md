# Client side Explanation./ # Server side Explanation.

This Java code defines a simple network client that can connect to a remote server over a network and engage in a chat with it.

Let's go over the code step-by-step:

The import statement imports the required Java libraries for working with network sockets and I/O streams.

The Client class is defined with three instance variables: a Socket object to establish a connection with the server, a BufferedReader object to read incoming messages from the server, and a PrintWriter object to send outgoing messages to the server.

The Client class constructor is defined. It creates a new Socket object, sets up the input and output streams for communication with the server, and starts two new threads, one for reading incoming messages from the server and another for writing outgoing messages to the server.

The startReading() method is defined. It creates a new thread that continuously reads incoming messages from the server and prints them to the console. If the server sends the message "exit", the method breaks out of the loop and terminates the chat.

The startWriting() method is defined. It creates a new thread that continuously reads user input from the console and sends it to the server via the PrintWriter object.

The main() method is defined. It simply creates a new Client object and starts the chat.

When the Client object is created and the main() method is invoked, the program connects to the server at the IP address "117.221.204.206" and port number 63381. The user can then enter messages in the console, which are sent to the server, and receive messages from the server, which are printed to the console.

Overall, this code demonstrates the basics of network programming with Java and how to use sockets, input streams, and output streams to establish a connection with a remote server and exchange data with it.

SERVER SIDE...........................................................................................................................................................
Let's go over the code step-by-step:

The import statement imports the required Java libraries for working with network sockets and I/O streams.

The Server class is defined with four instance variables: a ServerSocket object to listen for incoming connections from clients, a Socket object to establish a connection with a client, a BufferedReader object to read incoming messages from the client, and a PrintWriter object to send outgoing messages to the client.

The Server class constructor is defined. It creates a new ServerSocket object and waits for incoming connections from clients. When a connection is established, it sets up the input and output streams for communication with the client and starts two new threads, one for reading incoming messages from the client and another for writing outgoing messages to the client.

The startReading() method is defined. It creates a new thread that continuously reads incoming messages from the client and prints them to the console. If the client sends the message "exit", the method breaks out of the loop and terminates the chat.

The startWriting() method is defined. It creates a new thread that continuously reads user input from the console and sends it to the client via the PrintWriter object.

The main() method is defined. It simply creates a new Server object and starts the server.

When the Server object is created and the main() method is invoked, the program starts listening for incoming connections from clients on port number 63381. When a client connects, the server sets up the input and output streams for communication and the user can then enter messages in the console, which are sent to the client, and receive messages from the client, which are printed to the console.

Overall, this code demonstrates the basics of network programming with Java and how to use sockets, input streams, and output streams to establish a connection with a client and exchange data with it. However, there are a few issues with this code that need to be fixed.

First, there's a typo in the code where BufferReader should be changed to BufferedReader. Additionally, the startWriting() method seems to be missing a closing curly brace, which should be added before the thread is started.

Secondly, the Socket object is not being initialized with the client connection, causing a NullPointerException in the code. This can be fixed by changing server.accept(); to socket = server.accept(); after the server socket accepts a new client connection.

Finally, the code would benefit from error handling for unexpected disconnections and closing the input and output streams and sockets properly.
